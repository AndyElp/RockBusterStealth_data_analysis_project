# RockBusterStealth_data_analysis_project
This project was based on a fictional company, 'Rockbuster Stealth LLC', it is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

The project was all based on the use of SQL and various methods and fucntions were used to compile the final presentation. Some of these can be seen in the files included.
